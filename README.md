# HCM Economic Surface

This is not monetization.
This is allowance.

Value may pass through this surface.
Nothing is extracted.
Nothing is optimized.

No tracking.
No targeting.
No conversion logic.

Economic flow here is optional, silent, and non-binding.

This is not a business model.
This is not a revenue strategy.

This is a surface.

Artifacts may pass.
Money may appear.
Nothing is pursued.
